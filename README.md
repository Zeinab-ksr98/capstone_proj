# Sa7tak3ena
## Overview
The Lebanese healthcare system faces challenges due to limited resources, particularly in meeting the increasing demand for intensive and neonatal care units. This lack of resources presents significant challenges for patients in locating vacant beds nearby and for ambulance workflow. As the population grows, providing specialized care, especially during cases demanding intensive medical intervention, becomes inadequate. The current random call approach for finding vacant hospitals further complicates the situation.

üöë **Sa7tak3ena** seeks to revolutionize the healthcare system via hospital-patient connections, enhance transparency concerning hospital resources, and introduce automated procedures to minimize time spent on locating beds in emergency cases. This system aims to facilitate inter-hospital transfers, and the process of localization and reservation of the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), and emergency beds by providing real-time hospital capacity information and an online reservation system.

Our proposed solution involves grouping all different Lebanese ambulance agencies and hospitals in a centralized system to manage and ease their work, providing real-time information on ambulance vehicles and hospital bed availability near the patient's location. This system allows hospitals to manage their bed vacancies, sections, and contact information, while ambulances can manage paramedics and cars. It reduces crowded emergencies and ensures optimal use of resources, replacing an ambulance random call approach.

The system would allow patients to request bed reservations according to their needs, make their hospital-to-hospital transfer process easier, and allow ambulance services to be converted to hospital transfers if required. This would optimize the healthcare system's responsiveness during emergencies, manage hospital and ambulance work more effectively, and enhance patient care and outcomes.

## üéØProject Goal

Finding the nearest vacant ambulance, the ambulance's random transfer strategy, the struggle to access real-time hospital vacancy data, and the constant demand for emergency, ICU, and NICU beds complicate Lebanese healthcare services and threaten patients‚Äô lives. Developing a site where ambulances, hospitals, and patients can communicate makes healthcare more efficient, reduces patient wait times, and cuts ambulance diversion time.

A centralized system manages and facilitates hospital and ambulance work, providing real-time information on ambulance vehicles and hospital bed availability near the patient's location. Hospitals manage their bed vacancies, sections, and contact info, while ambulances manage paramedics, cars, and reservations. This optimizes the healthcare system's responsiveness during emergencies, manages hospital and ambulance work effectively, and enhances patient care and outcomes.
